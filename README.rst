Sunkit-Dem is an open-source package for computing solar differential emission measure distributions.

Installation
============

If you want to help develop sunkit-image, or just want to try out the package, you will need to install it from GitHub.
The best way to do this is to create a new python virtual environment (either with ``pipenv`` or ``conda``).
Once you have that virtual environment:

.. code:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-image.git
    $ cd sunkit-dem
    $ pip install -e .

For detailed (general) installation instructions, see the `installation guide`_ in the SunPy docs.

Contributing
============

We love contributions! sunkit-dem is open source,
built on open source, and we'd love to have you hang out in our community.
Head over to our chat room `#sunkit-dem:openastronomy.org`_ if you want to
let us know what you like to work on, or if you have any questions.
You can also check out the `issues page`_ for the list of known outstanding items.

**Imposter syndrome disclaimer**:

We want your help. No, really.
There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're not
ready to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly good
enough to contribute. What could you possibly offer a project like this one?

We assure you - the little voice in your head is wrong. If you can write code at
all, you can contribute code to open source. Contributing to open source
projects is a fantastic way to advance one's coding skills. Writing perfect code
isn't the measure of a good developer (that would disqualify all of us!); it's
trying to create something, making mistakes, and learning from those
mistakes. That's how we all improve, and we are happy to help others learn.

Being an open source contributor doesn't just mean writing code, either. You can
help out by writing documentation, tests, or even giving feedback about the
project (and yes - that includes giving feedback about the contribution
process). Some of these contributions may be the most valuable to the project as
a whole, because you're coming to the project with fresh eyes, so you can see
the errors and assumptions that seasoned contributors have glossed over.

Note: This disclaimer was originally written by
`Adrienne Lowe <https://github.com/adriennefriend>`_ for a
`PyCon talk <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Uj746j9Heo>`_, and was adapted by
sunkit-dem based on its use in the README file for the
`MetPy project <https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy>`_.
